# BACKGROUND

We have been commissioned by a company that sells models and mock-ups. The company already has a database listing employees, products, orders and much more. We are invited to explore and discover this database. The company director would like to have a dynamic dashboard that he can update every morning to get the latest information to manage the business.

The database is available on a company server. We access it in read-only mode with a user account provided. The company also provides us with the script we can run on our local MySQL server. The data are identical and stop at the end of the previous month.
